## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project. Once the project has been built, you can run the game by pressing the "Start" button.

## How to Play

Rummikub is played with tiles that are similar to playing cards. Each tile has a number and a color, and the goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of your tiles.

To start the game, each player is dealt 14 tiles. Players then take turns placing tiles on the table to form sets and runs. A set is three or four tiles of the same number in different colors, while a run is three or more tiles of the same color in numerical order.

Players can also add tiles to existing sets and runs on the table. The first player to get rid of all of their tiles wins the game.

## Playing Against the Computer

In this version of Rummikub, you can play against the computer. The computer has a basic logic that will try to get rid of tiles as quickly as possible. You can choose to go first or let the computer go first by clicking on the "Go First" or "Let Computer Go First" buttons.
